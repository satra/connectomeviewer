===========================================
Add network from Matlab connectivity matrix
===========================================

It is assumed that you have a connectivity matrix and node positions stored in
Matlab files (see `examples/matlab_import/data <https://github.com/unidesigner/connectomeviewer>`_). Here you learn how to directly load these data in ConnectomeViewer
and visualize the network.

The following code will do ::

    import networkx as nx
    import scipy.io as sio

    M = sio.loadmat('data/M.mat', matlab_compatible=True)
    A = M['ConMatrix']
    N = sio.loadmat('data/P.mat', matlab_compatible=True)
    P = N['Coordinate']

    cfile.add_network_from_matrix_with_pos(name='Network', matrix = A, pos = P, directed = False)
    cfile.networks[0].active = True
    cfile.networks[0].select_all()

You can either type the code line-by-line in the Ipython console or store it as a
script (Menu: File->New Text File. Ctrl-S to store it as .py file. Run it with Ctrl-R).

Alternatively, you can run the script in the ConnectomeViewer IPython shell with *run -i myscript.py*.
To get to know the current path, type *pwd*. Change paths using the *cd* command.

Of course you have to adapt the paths to your Matlab files and the names of your arrays. You can check the loaded data with::
	print M
	print M.keys()
Dive into the dictionary accordingly.

If you have a directed network (asymmetric matrix, set directed = True), the edges are
still displayed without arrows. But you can change this by opening the the *Mayavi Visualization Tree*
(Menu: View->Other). Double-click on Connections (parent node is Connectivity Source).
The *Mayavi Object Editor* show the changeable attributes. Under tab Glyph, subtab Glyph Source,
you select *Arrow Source*. Below you can adjust the look of the arrows of your directed network.
