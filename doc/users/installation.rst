Step-by-Step Guide for Installation on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Python Version 2.6 is needed. The installation procedure including installation of required packages,
downloading of sources, and compilation is automated by a sh-script.
Take first a look at the respective scripts in order to understand what they do.

* Download the `installation script <https://github.com/unidesigner/connectomeviewer/tree/master/scripts>`_ (Ubuntu / Fedora 11 or higher supported)

* You need to make the installation file executable::

    chmod +x install_cviewer_ubuntu.sh
    
* Start the installation and compilation (choose the appropriate script) ::

    sh ./install_cviewer_ubuntu10_10.sh

* Start the ConnectomeViewer in verbose mode::

    connectomeviewer.py -v

* If there are errors during the script execution, generate a log file and send it together with the startup logfile via email to `info[at]connectomics.org <mailto:info[at]connectomics.org>`_::

    sh ./install_cviewer_ubuntu.sh > logfile.txt

.. On first startup, a directory is created in your home folder (*$HOME/.enthought/ch.connectome.viewer*) to store the logfile and window settings. If the first startup was as root, you do not have write permission in this folder, leading to a *Permission Error*. Simply remove this folder (*sudo rm -rf $HOME/.enthought/ch.connectome.viewer/*) and start ConnectomeViewer again as user.

.. Step-by-Step Guide for Installation on Windows
.. ----------------------------------------------
.. * Install the recent EPD_ (License: Academic, Option: Install for all users). It is free for academic purposes, see button at the bottom of the page.
.. * To access HDF5 files, we need H5Py, you `install it from here <http://code.google.com/p/h5py/downloads/list>`_
.. * Install ConnectomeViewer executable `(from the download page) <http://www.connectomeviewer.org/users/download>`_
.. * Either select the ConnectomeViewer from the Startmenu (Connectome->ConnectomeViewer) or open a Command Prompt and type::
..     connectomeviewer.py -v
.. * You can `download example datasets <http://connectomeviewer.org/viewer/datasets>`_. Make sure that they end with *.cff* (however they are regular ZIP archives).
.. If you encounter any problems, please send an email to `info AT connectomics.org <mailto:infoATconnectomics.org>`_!
